From the summary, we can determine that rural areas are the most underserved with the highest average fare per ride at $34.62 and with total riders by city type being 5.3%  but with only 2.6% of total drivers by city type. The suburban area has an average fare per ride of $34.62  with 26.3%  of total riders by city type and 16.5% of total drivers. The urban areas with the lowest average per ride, with only $24.53, have a higher percentage of total drivers by city type and the highest total riders by city type, 80% 68.4%, respectively.

When we look at the total fares by city type, we can see that although there are months in all three city types that the total fares changes depending on the months, the total fares seem to remain consistent. With the urban city's total fares staying in the range of $1500-2500,  suburban areas staying with a range of $500-$1500 and, rural areas with a total fare of $0-$500.
